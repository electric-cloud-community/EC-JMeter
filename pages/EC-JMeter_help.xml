    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
What is the tool itself is used for in the development
process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>JMeter, from the Apache Software Foundation, is a Java
    application designed to load test functional behavior and
    measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web
    Applications but has since expanded to other test
    functions.</p>

    <p>More information can be found at <a href=
    "http://jmeter.apache.org/">JMeter</a>.</p>

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to JMeter</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
the plugin omit?
-->

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin calls the JMeter tool via command line
    and passes the user-provided parameters.</p>

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin includes the most important features
    provided by the JMeter tool, also allows some extra
    funcionality to make the test more configurable according to
    specific needs.</p>

    <p>ElectricFlow itself provides some advantages like
    parameters checking, easy functionality selection using only
    check boxes or radio buttons, hitorical log reports, procedure
    duration statistics, simple credentials attachment, real time
    analysis of the log been generated, among others.</p>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against JMeter version
    2.4.</p>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>
	<p>IMPORTANT: In the ElectricFlow UI, from the Home page, open the Main Menu, and click <b>Admin</b> > <b>Plugins</b> to open the Plugin Manager.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class='required'>bold
    italics</span>.</p>

    <div id="runJMeter"><a name='runJMeter' id="runJMeter"></a>

    <h3>Run JMeter</h3>

    <p>This procedure allows the input of all necessary parameters
    along with some extra of them to make the test more
    configurable. When the parameters are defined the JMeter test
    command is created and run into ElectricFlow, displaying at
    the end the result(s) of it. It displays a summary, which shows
    the date and time when the step started and finished. It also
    creates a log file, which contains the output generated by the
    console.</p>

    <h1>Examples and Use Cases</h1>
    <!-- This section is for examples and use cases, including screenshots of the new Parameter Panel with example values filled in.
Unfortunately, I can't tell you what exactly to put here, but it's OK to put what seems like too much! Include both parameter
values and output where appropriate. Use a separate 'h2' header for each example. Under the h2 header try to stay with the style
outline used above where possible.
